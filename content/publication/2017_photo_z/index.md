summary: We describe a general framework for properly constructing and assessing nonparametric conditional density estimators under selection bias, and for combining two or more estimators for optimal performance. This leads to new improved photo-z estimators. We illustrate our methods on data from the Sloan Data Sky Survey and an application to galaxy-galaxy lensing.
